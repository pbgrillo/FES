## Project Description 

Convert existing LabVIEW code into Actor Framework (LabVIEW's implementation of the actor model), for data acquisition and real-time control of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). The goal is to improve walking function in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). This project may, in conjunction with Project 2 below, lead to the development of a common software framework for FES control systems that we hope to reuse in our lab
